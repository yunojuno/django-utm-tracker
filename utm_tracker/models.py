class LeadSource(models.Model):
    """
    Model used to track inbound leads.

    The model is separate from the ClientOnboarding and FreelancerOnboarding
    models so that we can track both in one place, and also so that we can
    backfill all historical data (before those models existed).

    NB The User field is *not* unique - it is possible for one User to have
    come through multiple routes (i.e. seen multiple ads); how we determine
    which ad is the one that made them register is a point of debate - so
    in this model we just record the data - and let the analysis happen later.

    The fields in this model are based on the industry standard UTM fields (
    see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters for details).

    Most of the fields are optional, and included for completeness. Internal
    referrals do not have utm_* values associated with them, but the fields
    can be reused to identify the referrer.

    For example:

        medium: "referral"
        source: "internal"
        campaign: "profile" (e.g. book me)
        term: {{ referral token }}
        content: "book me"

    We are not using choices in this model as we can't predict what the params
    coming in from external sources may be, and we can't restrict the marketing
    team to specific values.
